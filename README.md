   In this paper, we make a series of explorations on the design of the Louvre emergency evacuation plan,and construct a comprehensive revenue model and an equilibrium flow model based on cellular automatafor the evacuation of the ground floor and the evacuation between floors. Finally, pathfinder software is applied to simulate and verify the optimal paths of the model solution.    

We first consider that the evacuation is evacuated from the building process, define the comprehensive benefit as the principle of ideal choice evacuation of personnel evacuation path, based on cellular automata thought, set the maximum comprehensive benefit grid for the direction of the cellular state transition, which based on cellular automata evacuation path model of comprehensive income.    

For the selection of evacuation path between floors, an equilibrium flow model is constructed to balance the flow of people in different paths and realize the reasonable distribution of people in public sections, so as to reduce the degree of evacuation congestion and evacuation time.    

Cellular automata simulation by matlab to explore the influence of different factors on the evacuation rules, which determine the gain coefficient of different evacuation situation of optimal value range, using the three-dimensional evacuation simulation software pathfinder to various circumstances evacuation path for simulation model, and compared with the short circuit model to determine the evacuation route, found that the present model to determine the evacuation efficiency of path is optimal; In addition, a three-dimensional
model of the Louvre is built by pathfinder, and the corresponding evacuation paths are obtained through simulation.    

Finally, the models are evaluated and generalized, and the policy and procedural recommendations for Louvre emergency management are given based on the research conclusions of this paper.

本文对罗浮宫应急疏散方案的设计进行了一系列的探索，建立了基于元胞自动机的一层疏散和层间疏散综合收益模型和均衡流模型。最后，应用寻路软件对模型解的最优路径进行了仿真验证。

我们首先考虑疏散撤离大楼过程,定义理想的综合效益为原则选择疏散人员疏散路径,基于元胞自动机的思想,设定的最大综合效益网格方向的细胞状态转换,基于细胞自动机的疏散路径模型的综合收入。

在楼层间疏散路径的选择上，建立均衡流模型，平衡不同路径上的人流，实现公共区域内人流的合理分布，从而降低疏散拥堵程度和疏散时间。

细胞自动机由matlab仿真,以探究不同因素对疏散的影响规则,确定不同的疏散情况的增益系数的最优值范围,使用三维疏散模拟软件探路者各种情况下疏散路径仿真模型,并与短路模型确定疏散路线,发现本模型确定的路径疏散效率是最优的;此外，利用寻路器建立了卢浮宫的三维模型，并通过仿真得到相应的疏散路径。

最后，根据本文的研究结论，对模型进行了评价和归纳，并提出了卢浮宫应急管理的政策和程序建议。
